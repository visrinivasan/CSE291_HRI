Project Soccer Pro is based on combining 2 ideas - using robot to make a fun interactive game, teaching preschool kids the basics of Soccer. Thus, the project aims at making an interactive game that has been broadly divided into 4 tasks. The different modes are activated based on select phrases like Fetch, Save, Score and Pass. 

Ball fetch module fetches the ball and gives an audio feedback on fetching it. Robot in Ball pass mode will keep track of the ball and pass the ball to the user. Goal Kick is a robust module that will adjust itself until the ball and the goal are aligned and then score the goal. Goal Save will predict the direction based on the ballâ€™s motion and prevent the user from scoring the goal.
